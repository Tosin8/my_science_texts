Bloc State Managements

It consists of 3 core values : 
- Simple: Easy to understand & can be used by developers with varying skill levels.
- Powerful : Help make amazing, complex applications by composing them of smaller components.
- Testable: Easily test every aspect of an application so that we can iterate with confidence.

Bloc Concepts. 
_____________________________
 * Streams : A stream is a sequence of asynchronous data.

In order to use the bloc library, it is critical to have a basic understanding of Streams and how they work.
We can create a Stream in Dart by writing an async* (async generator) function.
- Every time we use the keyword 'yield' in an 'async*' function we are pushing that piece of data through the Stream.
- Every time we use the keyword 'await' in a 'async' function and return a 'Future'

Asynchronous Programming: Streams
_________________________________________
It is characterized by the 'Future' and 'Stream' classes. 

2. Cubit
A Cubit is a class which extends BlocBase and can be extended to manage any type of state.
