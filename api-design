- APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, provide a manner in which software applications communicate with each other. 

- They define the methods and data formats an application should use in order to perform tasks, like sending, retrieving, or modifying data.

THE BASICS..........
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an integral part of modern development, allowing software applications to communicate and use functions from other software applications or services

HTTP Versions in API Design
___________________________________
The versions specify how versions should respond to commands, which directly impacts how well an API can communicate with other software and systems. 

HTTP Methods
___________________
It play a significant role in API design, defining the type of request a client can make to a server. 
Common methods are: GET, POSt, PUT, DELETE and PATCH, allowing various interactions with API endpoints. 

HTTP Status Codes
_________________________
They are essential part of API Design, providing important information about the result of a request made to a server. 
eg. 404 - signifies that a request resource could not be found on the server, 200 - for successful HTTP request.
