*Computer architecture is about the structure and operation of digital computers.
 Computer architecture is concerned with the operational methods of the hardware; 
with the services provided by operating system software; with the acquisition, 
processing, storage, and output of data;
and with the interaction between computers.

There is a tendency for people in information systems and technology
 to neglect a study of computer architecture.
