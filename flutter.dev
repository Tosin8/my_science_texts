Beyond UI - backend. 
DATA AND BACKEND. 
A. State Management. 
- It consists of both an Ephemeral State and an App State. 
The ephemeral state is the state that can be neatly contained in a single widget. Examples are: Current page in a PageView, Current progress of a complex animation

The app state: state being shared across many parts of the app. E.g: 
- User preferences
- Login info
- Notifications in a social networking app
- The shopping cart in an ecommerce app etc.
