Flutter architectural overview

overview is divided into a number of sections:

* The layer model: The pieces from which Flutter is constructed.
* Reactive user interfaces: A core concept for Flutter user interface development.
* An introduction to widgets: The fundamental building blocks of Flutter user interfaces.
* The rendering process: How Flutter turns UI code into pixels.
* An overview of the platform embedders: The code that lets mobile and desktop OSes execute Flutter apps.
* Integrating Flutter with other code: Information about different techniques available to Flutter apps.
* Support for the web: Concluding remarks about the characteristics of Flutter in a browser environment.

Difference between Ephemeral and App State.
 * Ephemeral State: Ephemeral state (sometimes called UI state or local state) is the state you can neatly contain in a single widget.
examples.
- current page in a PageView
- current progress of a complex animation
- current selected tab in a BottomNavigationBar

 * App: State that is not ephemeral, that you want to share across many parts of your app, and that you want to keep between user sessions, is what we call application state (sometimes also called shared state).

Examples of application state:

User preferences
Login info
Notifications in a social networking app
The shopping cart in an e-commerce app
Read/unread state of articles in a news app
