PART 1 - REGISTRY OVERVIEW
  Chapter One - Leaning the basics 

  Heart and Souls of windows
____________________________________________
* Windows stores configuration data in the registry. The registry is a hierarchical data-base, which can be described as a central repository for configuration data or as a configuration database.
* A hierar-chical database’s characteristics make it ideally suited for storing configuration data. 
* You can't do nothing in windows without access to the registry. Every application being used looks for it's settings in the registry. 
* Registry is also called the systems heart and soul, the registry by its very nature allows complex relationships among different parts of Windows, appli-cations, and the user interface.

  Power Users 
________________________________
* The better way is to learn more about Windows is to figure out how and where it stores settings. 

  For IT professionals 
_________________________________
* An indirect but important benefit of the registry for IT professionals is application compatibility.
* Microsoft defines standards for the locations in which different types of settings belong in the registry.

  Must Know Concepts 
_____________________________________
* Disclaimer: The registry is filled with hexadecimal numbers, and if not understood, it will not be clear.

  Security Identify
__________________________________________
*  Computer accounts, user accounts, groups, and other security-related objects are security principles.
*  Security Identifiers (SIDs) 
       - It uniquely identify security principles. Each time Windows and Active Directory create a security principle, they generate a SID for it.
*  The Windows Local Security Authority (LSA) 
       - It generates SIDs for local security principles and then stores them in the local security database.
* The Domain Security Authority ( DSA ) 
       - It generates SIDs for domain security principles and then stores them in Active Direc-tory.

Disclaimer: 
 SIDs are unique within their scope. Every local security principle’s SID is unique on the computer, 
and every domain security principle’s SID is unique within any domain in the enterprise.
Windows and Active Directory never reuse a SID, even if they delete the security principle to which that SID belonged. 
Thus, if you delete an account and then add it back, the account gets a new SID.

Registry Structure - 
 Root Keys: 
  - (Name) HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  (abbrevitation) HKCR
  - (Name) HKEY_CURRENT_USER  (abbreviation) HKCU
  - (Name) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (abbreviation) HKLM
  - (Name) HKEY_USERS (abbreviation) HKU
  - (Name) HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (abbreviation) HKCC  

Values
 - A value's name is similar to a file's name. 
 - A value's type is similar to a file's extension.
 - A values' data is similar to the file's acutal content. 
 
      Name: Every value has a name, within each key - value names must be unique but different keys can have values with the same name. 
      Type: Each value's type determines the type of data that it contains, 
      Data: Each value can be empty or null or it can contain data, the practical limit is 2kb, the data usually corresponds to the type, except that binary values can contain strings, double words or anything else. 

Types 
  Windows supprt the following types of data in the registry, REG_BINARY, REG_DWORD and REG_SZ account for the vast majority of all the settings in the registry. 
  
   - REG_BINARY: binary data. Registry editor displays binary data in hexadecimal notation. 
   - REG_DWORD: double word values.
   - REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN: double word values with the most significant bytes stored first in memory. The order of the bytes is the opposite of the order in which REG_DWORD stores them. 
   - REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN: double word values with the least significant byes stored first in memory. 
   - REG_EXPAND_SZ
   
 
 HKEY_USERS
 It consists at least of 3 subkeys: 
  - .DEFAULT: containing the per user settings that windows uses to display the desktop before any user logs on to the computer. 
  - SID: being the security identifier of the console user , contains per user settings. 
  - SID_Classes, where SID is the security identify of the console user, containing per user class registrations and file associations. 
  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

Chapter 2 : Using registry editor
 * Registry Editor is the tool been used to edit the registry directly. Registry is being changed every time user log on to the computer,
 and it also been done  indirectly through Control Panel or the Run dialog box, which updates the registry’s list of programs that's been run recently.
 * With Registry Editor,  settings are being affected without the help of a user inter-face.
