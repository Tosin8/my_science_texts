PART 1 - REGISTRY OVERVIEW
  Chapter One - Leaning the basics 

  Heart and Souls of windows
____________________________________________
* Windows stores configuration data in the registry. The registry is a hierarchical data-base, which can be described as a central repository for configuration data or as a configuration database.
* A hierar-chical database’s characteristics make it ideally suited for storing configuration data. 
* You can't do nothing in windows without access to the registry. Every application being used looks for it's settings in the registry. 
* Registry is also called the systems heart and soul, the registry by its very nature allows complex relationships among different parts of Windows, appli-cations, and the user interface.

  Power Users 
________________________________
* The better way is to learn more about Windows is to figure out how and where it stores settings. 

  For IT professionals 
_________________________________
* An indirect but important benefit of the registry for IT professionals is application compatibility.
* Microsoft defines standards for the locations in which different types of settings belong in the registry.

  Must Know Concepts 
_____________________________________
* Disclaimer: The registry is filled with hexadecimal numbers, and if not understood, it will not be clear.

  Security Identify
__________________________________________
*  Computer accounts, user accounts, groups, and other security-related objects are security principles.
*  Security Identifiers (SIDs) 
       - It uniquely identify security principles. Each time Windows and Active Directory create a security principle, they generate a SID for it.
*  The Windows Local Security Authority (LSA) 
       - It generates SIDs for local security principles and then stores them in the local security database.
* The Domain Security Authority ( DSA ) 
       - It generates SIDs for domain security principles and then stores them in Active Direc-tory.

Disclaimer: 
 SIDs are unique within their scope. Every local security principle’s SID is unique on the computer, 
and every domain security principle’s SID is unique within any domain in the enterprise.
Windows and Active Directory never reuse a SID, even if they delete the security principle to which that SID belonged. 
Thus, if you delete an account and then add it back, the account gets a new SID.
